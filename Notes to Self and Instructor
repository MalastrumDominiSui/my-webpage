<!-- some general notes:  

I had a lot of fun with this! I focused a lot on how it looks, mainly because I was
sensitive that it would look too much like a webpage from the 1990's.

There must be a better way to organize my CSS, especially the images and their sizes.
I simply wrote it chronologically, as I needed a new element of CSS, I wrote it next.
The assignment specified that all the CSS elements should be contained in the CSS file,
and I feel as if having image sizes "height" and "width" are CSS elements that need to be
in the CSS file, though I am really not sure how to create specific images for specific
purposes, and while I know the answer exists, for me it fell outside the time requirement
for completing this project.


I was hoping to classify the images so that they could be specific types of images, for
example the bottom link images versus the larger page images, and clickable images
versus non clickable images.  I managed to do this by classifying that only <a> tag
images had a hover function (something I stole from learning a bit at Do Space's
Hello Code).

I have a general problem that there is an invisible clickable portion
of pictures between <a> <img>s.  It was previously underlined, until I disabled 
underline on hyperlink text, for other reasons, not specifically to make it dissapear.
Thus I know it has something to do with the hyperlink 
text, but after some research, I can't find anything conclusive to help me eliminate it.
I tried to eliminate rogue spaces, but still no luck.  I am interested in the answer or
a hint on this conundrum.

I want to know how to create a circular image, make sure all the images are the same size, but without
warping the actual picture to stretch to different dimensions, e.g. the sushi image
is compressed horizontally, but stretching it will break symmetry.-->
